# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on ensuring all pages in the LumenSlate Flutter web application are fully responsive across mobile (0-450px), tablet (451-800px), and desktop (801-1920px) screen sizes. The application currently has partial responsive implementation with desktop/mobile folders for most pages, but lacks comprehensive tablet support and consistent responsive behavior across all pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher using LumenSlate on a mobile device, I want all pages to display properly and be fully functional on my phone screen, so that I can manage my classes and assignments while on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any page on a mobile device (0-450px width) THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout with appropriate touch targets and navigation
2. WHEN content exceeds the mobile screen width THEN the system SHALL wrap or scroll content appropriately without horizontal overflow
3. WHEN interactive elements are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum 44px touch targets for accessibility
4. WHEN forms are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL stack form fields vertically and optimize input field sizes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher using LumenSlate on a tablet device, I want all pages to utilize the available screen space effectively, so that I can have a productive experience that's optimized for tablet interaction patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any page on a tablet device (451-800px width) THEN the system SHALL display a tablet-optimized layout that utilizes available screen space effectively
2. WHEN displaying lists or grids on tablet THEN the system SHALL show more items per row than mobile but fewer than desktop
3. WHEN showing navigation elements on tablet THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly navigation that works well with tablet interaction patterns
4. WHEN displaying forms on tablet THEN the system SHALL optimize field layouts for tablet screen dimensions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher using LumenSlate on a desktop computer, I want all pages to take advantage of the larger screen real estate, so that I can view more information at once and work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any page on a desktop device (801-1920px width) THEN the system SHALL display a desktop-optimized layout that maximizes screen real estate usage
2. WHEN displaying data tables or lists on desktop THEN the system SHALL show multiple columns and more items per view
3. WHEN showing navigation on desktop THEN the system SHALL provide full navigation menus and sidebars where appropriate
4. WHEN displaying forms on desktop THEN the system SHALL arrange fields in multi-column layouts where space permits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the LumenSlate codebase, I want consistent responsive patterns across all pages, so that the code is maintainable and follows established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing responsive layouts THEN the system SHALL use the existing responsive_framework breakpoints consistently
2. WHEN creating page layouts THEN the system SHALL follow the established desktop/mobile/tablet folder structure pattern
3. WHEN handling responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL use ResponsiveBreakpoints.of(context) for breakpoint detection
4. WHEN implementing responsive widgets THEN the system SHALL create reusable responsive components where possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a teacher switching between different devices, I want consistent functionality across all screen sizes, so that I can seamlessly continue my work regardless of the device I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN core functionality is accessed on any device THEN the system SHALL provide the same features across all breakpoints
2. WHEN navigation is used on any device THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation patterns adapted for each screen size
3. WHEN data is displayed on any device THEN the system SHALL show the same information with layout optimized for the screen size
4. WHEN user interactions are performed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and responses across all devices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a teacher with accessibility needs, I want all responsive layouts to maintain accessibility standards, so that I can use the application effectively regardless of my device or assistive technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN responsive layouts are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper semantic HTML structure across all breakpoints
2. WHEN touch targets are rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum 44px touch target sizes on mobile and tablet
3. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain readable font sizes and contrast ratios across all screen sizes
4. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL provide consistent tab order and focus management across breakpoints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a teacher using LumenSlate, I want smooth transitions when rotating my device or resizing my browser window, so that my workflow isn't disrupted by layout changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to the appropriate responsive layout
2. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout in real-time without content jumping or breaking
3. WHEN breakpoint transitions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain user context and scroll position where possible
4. WHEN responsive layouts change THEN the system SHALL preserve form data and user input states
