# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Authentication & User Management feature provides secure user authentication and role-based access control for the LumenSlate platform. This system enables users to sign in using Google or phone authentication, maintains persistent sessions, and manages user profiles with appropriate role-based permissions for teachers and students.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher or student, I want to sign in using my Google account, so that I can quickly access the platform without creating separate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Sign in with Google" button THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
2. WHEN a user completes Google OAuth flow THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve their user profile
3. WHEN Google authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store authentication tokens securely
4. IF a user cancels Google OAuth flow THEN the system SHALL return to the login screen with appropriate messaging
5. WHEN a user signs in with Google for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new user profile with default role assignment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher or student, I want to sign in using my phone number, so that I can access the platform even without a Google account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid phone number THEN the system SHALL send an OTP via SMS
2. WHEN a user enters the correct OTP within 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user
3. IF a user enters an incorrect OTP THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
4. WHEN OTP expires after 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL require a new OTP request
5. WHEN a user signs in with phone for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new user profile with default role assignment
6. WHEN a user requests OTP resend THEN the system SHALL wait 30 seconds before allowing another request

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want users to have persistent authentication sessions, so that they don't need to sign in repeatedly during normal usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL maintain their session for 30 days
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens the application THEN the system SHALL automatically restore their authenticated session
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login screen
4. WHEN a user explicitly signs out THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate their session
5. WHEN a user is inactive for 7 days THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication on next access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want role-based access to teaching features, so that I can create assignments and manage classrooms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with teacher role accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL display teacher-specific navigation and features
2. WHEN a teacher attempts to create assignments THEN the system SHALL allow access to assignment creation tools
3. WHEN a teacher attempts to view student submissions THEN the system SHALL allow access to grading interfaces
4. IF a user without teacher role attempts to access teacher features THEN the system SHALL deny access and display appropriate messaging
5. WHEN a teacher role is assigned to a user THEN the system SHALL immediately update their permissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want role-based access to student features, so that I can view and complete assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with student role accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL display student-specific navigation and features
2. WHEN a student attempts to view assignments THEN the system SHALL show only assignments assigned to them
3. WHEN a student attempts to submit work THEN the system SHALL allow submission to their assigned tasks
4. IF a user without student role attempts to access student-specific features THEN the system SHALL deny access appropriately
5. WHEN a student role is assigned to a user THEN the system SHALL immediately update their permissions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information, so that I can keep my account details current and personalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display current profile information including name, email, phone, and role
2. WHEN a user updates their profile information THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes
3. WHEN a user uploads a profile picture THEN the system SHALL resize and store the image appropriately
4. IF a user enters invalid profile data THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent saving
5. WHEN a user changes their email address THEN the system SHALL require email verification before updating
6. WHEN a user updates their phone number THEN the system SHALL require OTP verification before updating

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure token management, so that user sessions are protected against unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms
2. WHEN tokens are transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them when possible
4. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL require user re-authentication
5. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all associated tokens
6. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL invalidate sessions and require re-authentication

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during authentication processes, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested actions
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL display offline messaging and retry options
4. WHEN OTP is sent THEN the system SHALL confirm the phone number and provide resend options
5. WHEN profile updates are saved THEN the system SHALL display success confirmation
