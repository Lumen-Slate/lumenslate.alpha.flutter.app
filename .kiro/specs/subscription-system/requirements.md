# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The subscription system feature will integrate RevenueCat for cross-platform subscription management in the LumenSlate Flutter app. This system will provide multiple subscription tiers with usage-based limits, handle purchase flows, validate entitlements, and enforce plan restrictions. The feature aims to monetize the AI-powered teaching assistant platform while providing clear value propositions for different user segments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to view available subscription plans with clear pricing and feature comparisons, so that I can choose the plan that best fits my teaching needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the pricing screen THEN the system SHALL display all available subscription tiers with their features and pricing
2. WHEN a user toggles between monthly and annual billing THEN the system SHALL show a 15% discount for annual plans
3. WHEN displaying plan features THEN the system SHALL clearly show usage limits for each tier (messages, documents, exports, etc.)
4. IF a user is on the Free tier THEN the system SHALL highlight upgrade benefits and limitations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to purchase a subscription plan through the app, so that I can unlock premium features and higher usage limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a subscription plan THEN the system SHALL initiate the RevenueCat purchase flow
2. WHEN a purchase is successful THEN the system SHALL update the user's entitlements immediately
3. WHEN a purchase fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
4. IF a user already has an active subscription THEN the system SHALL handle plan upgrades and downgrades appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to restore my previous purchases when I reinstall the app or switch devices, so that I don't lose access to my paid subscription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps "Restore Purchases" THEN the system SHALL query RevenueCat for existing entitlements
2. WHEN valid purchases are found THEN the system SHALL restore the user's subscription status
3. WHEN no purchases are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user appropriately
4. IF restoration fails THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the app to enforce usage limits based on my subscription tier, so that the pricing model is fair and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to use a feature THEN the system SHALL check their current entitlement and usage limits
2. WHEN a user reaches their daily/weekly limit THEN the system SHALL prevent further usage and suggest upgrading
3. WHEN a user's subscription expires THEN the system SHALL revert them to Free tier limits
4. IF a user exceeds their limit THEN the system SHALL display clear messaging about their current plan restrictions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want my subscription status to be validated securely and persist across app sessions, so that I have consistent access to paid features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL validate the user's subscription status with RevenueCat
2. WHEN subscription data is received THEN the system SHALL store it securely using flutter_secure_storage
3. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL use cached subscription data for entitlement checks
4. IF subscription validation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to Free tier with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to manage my subscription (cancel, modify) through the platform's native billing system, so that I have full control over my subscription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to cancel their subscription THEN the system SHALL direct them to the appropriate platform billing settings
2. WHEN a subscription is cancelled THEN the system SHALL continue providing access until the end of the billing period
3. WHEN a subscription auto-renews THEN the system SHALL update entitlements accordingly
4. IF there are billing issues THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide resolution steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean service architecture for subscription management, so that the code is maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing subscription features THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated SubscriptionService class
2. WHEN handling subscription state THEN the system SHALL use BLoC pattern for state management
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry logic
4. IF subscription logic changes THEN the system SHALL maintain separation between data, service, and UI layers

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to see my current usage statistics and remaining limits, so that I can track my consumption and plan accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their profile or dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current usage statistics
2. WHEN usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL provide proactive notifications
3. WHEN displaying usage THEN the system SHALL show both current period consumption and total limits
4. IF a user wants detailed usage history THEN the system SHALL provide access to historical data
